# Job protocol v1

Planned (#138): the encrypted manifest and result formats shared by the client
(`packages/vethuq-github`) and the worker.

- `manifest.schema.json`: protocol version, job id, user settings, page list, licence token(s)
  and add-on entitlements, per-job caps, batching info
- `result.schema.json`: per-page text, lines, confidence, phase, language, timings and billable
  duration, partial-result marker, metrics
- `examples/` and `fixtures/`: synthetic data used by both sides' tests

Changes within v1 are additive; unknown major versions are refused by client and worker.
